## Changes in functionality

- custom URL can now be changed as many times as you want

  - same restrictions apply as before: can't have same custom URL as some other user

- Twitter, YouTube and Twitch are no longer synced up with Discord. Instead you set these in your profile settings.

  - This was done so that the minimum amount of information from Discord can be requested (now it is only your username and avatar) and make sure you have exactly the accounts showing on sendou.ink you want

- Top 500 placements are no tied to account instead of Twitter name. Changing Twitter name no longer unlinks your Top 500 placements. Twitter is no longer required to link your Top 500 placements to your user account.

  - This was in the previous update (above is just a recap)

- Top 500 placements are not shown on user page directly anymore

  - Instead displayed is peak ranking in each mode and a link to a new /player/ page with full details

- Builds page now allows advanced filtering
