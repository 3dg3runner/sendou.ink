# Introduction

Welcome to the Advanced section. This section aims to further build upon the strategies written in the fundamentals. It is recommended to only start using the advanced strategies after you made yourself comfortable applying the fundamentals in shifts.

These strategies have a smaller impact on the overall Golden Egg score compared to the fundamentals, but start becoming essential once you get to pushing the score to its absolute limit.

# Pace

## Understanding and practice

Pace was already introduced in the fundamentals. However, due to the large impact it has on the egg score we would like to further explain what should be done to improve pace and how it correlates to SR.

In its simple form, pace is how technical skill translates to the game. If you move faster, have better accuracy, respond to things faster, and decide on actions faster you will do more tasks in the game.

You’ll probably notice that a lot of these relate to execution. As such, knowing how to improve execution is important.

The goal is to have all execution done with as little effort as possible. The less time you need to think about how to execute something or move, the more you can spend that time thinking about more strategic aspects or focus on awareness. For example, when it comes to advanced movement like substrafing, or other difficult tasks like one cycling a Steelhead with Rapid Blaster Pro, these should be executed with little to no thinking.
There are several ways to get familiar with such tasks. For example, to get comfortable with substrafing you want to spend your games substrafing as much as you possibly can. By constantly substrafing you’re making yourself aware that you need to improve your pace and prevent going into autopilot and old habits. Eventually the constant substrafing will become the new “normal” movement. Similarly, other movements and techniques can be practiced by using the training room, or again by repeating these actions as much as possible during games.

## Tunnelling and balance

An important aspect for improving pace is tunnelling, or as mentioned earlier going into autopilot. Tunnelling should be avoided as much as possible.
When a player starts tunnelling, they lose awareness of their surroundings as they focus on the single task they’re tunnelling onto. A common example of tunnelling in SR is focusing too much on luring and killing a griller, only to get ambushed by another griller that went unnoticed. Tunnelling, even when it appears for just a few seconds, is a common concept that will result in a slower pace.

Therefore, players should always make themselves conscious of everything they do in a game. This is where a balance in familiarity and consciousness become vital. As mentioned earlier, a player should be comfortable to perform any kind of action with as little effort and thinking as possible. However, it’s still important that players are conscious of everything they do to avoid tunnelling.

## Pace vs. speed

In the context of SR it’s worth mentioning that pace does not only translate to fast kills. You can kill a steelhead really fast when it spawns, but your pace will likely suffer due to the eggs spawning far from the basket. Pace includes the actions you take in a game and particularly if these actions either speed up or slow down the process of getting all the Golden Eggs.
Especially in HLM (Hazard Level Max) it will happen that you’re dealing with multiple spawn groups at once. Knowing where to engage and which spawn groups to lure is where the limits of someone’s pace are being tested.

SR has the advantage of being perfectly predictable in terms of how bosses and lessers behave, while also keeping track of the team’s positioning. However, this further increases how far pace can be pushed in this mode. Being able to analyze complex scenarios and instantly deciding on the right action and executing them as fast as possible is the goal for SR. It has a major impact on the egg score and should be a high priority for every player aiming to get high scores.

# Abilities & Mindset

## Short-term Memory

In Salmon Run, short-term memory is an ability that is definitely worth honing. It can help your awareness and execution. For example: remembering what bosses are around so you can adapt your movement to not break lures, such as Steelhead end wave lures on Marooner's Bay. It also can be applied to remembering where bosses were killed, far or at basket, so all of the Golden Eggs can be retrieved. That notion can be connected to Snatcher Awareness. Boss cycles can also apply so that you can multitask with killing and running eggs.

## Multitasking

This is a really important aspect to improve on to increase your awareness and productivity for higher Golden Eggs. Many aspiring players tend to fall into the trap of "slayer" and "egg runner," but it's not an optimal way to view the mode at higher level gameplay. Ideally, every player should be going for Golden Eggs and boss kills at the same time. For example: grabbing a Golden Egg from a Stinger you just killed, making sure to pass by basket with far eggs while going across the map, or throwing bombs at lesser hordes/Maws/Flyfish while running any eggs far or at basket.

## Muscle Memory & Experience

Over time, you'll be able to build qualities that may seem advanced at first. This relates to the earlier section of Pace, or is a small extension of it. As you play more of the maps and input controls faster than you did before, your spatial memory and reaction speed starts increasing. It's easy to get flustered or make mistakes, so make sure to do it at your own timing and not someone else's. For example: You'll slowly start understanding the locations of where Golden Eggs and bosses spawn as you play more, so you'll build confidence in doing the same task over and over. As that happens, you can slowly up your pace to increase the amount of things you can do which increases the net gain of Golden Eggs for the wave/shift. Being comfortable with the geography of maps will allow you to reach bosses and go towards Golden Eggs at the same time. Understanding situations is essential as well since as you see the same situations and their results you'll be able to know what to do the next time it comes up. It also can apply to weapon roles and what to do with them based on the map, tide, wave, and rotation.

## 4 Player Mode

By far one of the biggest ideas to understanding the mode at its roots, besides acknowledging that pace matters since there is a timer, is that there are 3 other players around you. Many people when squadding or trying to improve at Overfishing tend to act selfishly and solo, which defeats the purpose of having a team to rely on. For example, you have to understand that there are actually 4 ink tanks on the map, not just yours. This can help with understanding special usage since using a special not only refills your own ink tank and protects you but can protect others and allow them to refill their ink tank. Many players tend to fight against the flow of the wave by acting selfishly, such as using a Splashdown on a Steelhead that a charger teammate saw or constantly stopping bosses at the end of the map when the other 3 are at basket waiting to lure. To be able to "see" the others and understand your role is especially important. This can be applied to special waves such as High Tide Mothership on Ark which involves a lot of trust to go for a Golden Egg even if a Snatcher is taking it instead of retreating and taking someone else's Golden Egg, or trusting a Hydra Splatling to stun a Griller even if you're right in front of its path. This can also be connected to the idea of host and non-host and weapon roles, where each trusts each other to run the correct Golden Eggs based on distance to the basket and how easy a weapon can get to a Golden Egg based on that distance. At the end of the day it's never about yourself, it's about the team.

## Unconventional Behavior

While Overfishing, the 1st priority everyone must have is raising the amount of Golden Eggs deposited. In many cases, the ends can justify the means. That's why breaking the fundamentals of Salmon Run is essential in Overfishing. For example many players oppose the idea of shooting Maws when in reality it can be a good choice depending on situational context, more information here: [Why shooting Maws is a good thing](https://youtu.be/BpS_zA9KG3c). Another example is dying in the water during High Tide Rush on Marooner's Bay if no specials are available to give time to the other players to refill ink and grab scattered Golden Eggs. Stopping bosses at the end of the map during the middle of a wave to lure, or not killing something on purpose since you notice it's desynced are all fine since they may lead to more Golden Eggs at the end of the wave.

# Snatcher Awareness and Optimization

As you improve, the ability to keep an internal clock of everything becomes increasingly more important. This includes Snatchers, and also using Snatchers to your advantage.

It is always preferred to grab far eggs in groups of 3 players. However, this won’t always happen, often due to other more important threats, or lack in team synergy. The time it takes for a Snatcher to grab eggs is consistent and can therefore always be predicted. As such, it becomes necessary to keep an internal clock of every Snatcher in the game to avoid eggs from getting lost to Snatchers.

When you start applying the fundamentals, getting all the far eggs may be challenging. However, once you start becoming comfortable with the fundamentals, these far eggs are what ends up making the difference for even higher egg scores.

In some locations, Snatchers can even be used to your advantage to help decrease the distance for grabbing the eggs. Below is a list of examples of commonly used optimizations. While some of these may seem small, especially when it comes to getting the highest possible egg score, these small distances start making a difference.

Some common examples of Snatcher optimization:

# Host and Non-host

## Basket radius and lagless deposits

The host of the room is able to grab and deposit golden eggs without any lag. Done optimally, the host can grab roughly ~1.6 eggs per second. In some situations (especially towards the end of the wave), letting the host grab the eggs right next to the basket can net the team extra eggs compared to if the host had not collected those eggs. Mashing A can help not to lose time with depositing/grabbing eggs quickly as host.

The area around the basket within which a player can deposit eggs is practically the same as the lit area surrounding the basket (or the uninkable part around the basket on Ruins of Ark Polaris). Abusing this knowledge and executing well can let the host deposit eggs at the edge of that radius without losing time at all.

## Fog and Goldies

On Fog, it is usually preferable to let the host collect eggs from 10-egg Goldies during or towards the end of the wave to minimize time losses, unless the host is needed for something else due to their weapon, or someone else has a slow weapon like the Hydra Splatling (only in the middle of the wave). The team should be ready to use specials against bosses when egg running becomes a high priority for the host due to multiple 10-egg Goldies so as to keep up with boss spawns.

## Egg magnet

If a non-host player attempts to grab an egg at the exact same time as another player, and that player fails to grab the egg, they will be given a nearby egg in compensation if there is one. This allows for tricks such as grabbing an egg through an eel or another enemy/obstacle, grabbing an egg in the air, etc. This trick becomes very effective when multiple players go for far eggs together and attempt to grab the same egg.

## Straight and fastest paths: saving time easily

Learning what paths are the fastest (usually straight paths towards the basket) is an easy way to save time for each egg deposit, especially as a non-host player. Paths that can make egg collection slower are those that have a wall or hazards on the way. Sometimes, a slightly slower path can end up being faster if the fastest path has hazards on it or is covered in enemy ink and the player has a weapon like Explosher, which needs time between shooting and using squid form.

## Lesser Aggro Delay and Drizzler Torpedo Delay

An advantage to non-host players is that there is a delay (the same as egg lag) before nearby lesser Salmonids become aggro’d onto them. This can make it easy to collect eggs quickly between lesser Salmonids before they can react (especially on high tide Ruins of Ark Polaris, where non-host players can try to jump to the sides and grab an egg quickly before some enemies react).

Drizzler torpedoes are also affected by a similar delay. Once the number of hits required to deflect/reflect a torpedo has been reached, there will be a delay (for non-host players, still) before the torpedo starts deflecting. This means that for players who have some lag to the host (EU host and JP-non host, for example), they can deal enough damage to a torpedo and quickly relocate to have the torpedo reflected towards the Drizzler (and get the kill) in a way that wouldn’t be possible for the host. With enough lag and quick relocation, you can get interesting kills!

**All of the aforementioned tricks for this section are of great importance to Princess shifts, as a good Princess needs to make egg deposits as quickly as possible.**

# Weapon specific techniques

Many weapons in Splatoon have more in depth techniques to them, which makes it much easier and more efficient to use them. This goes beyond the core mechanics of weapons (such as rolling with dapples for higher DPS, or keeping short range mode on ballpoint), and rather looks at more in depth techniques.

Most prominent in SR are one-cycles: being able to kill bosses in a single cycle when their hitbox is exposed. Due to the variation in DPS (Damage Per Second) on weapons, some low DPS weapons will just barely be able to achieve these one-cycles for certain bosses. Some even resulting in very specific techniques to be required. Below is a list made by Marty where you can see which weapons can or cannot one-cycle certain bosses:
[Salmon Run: Drizzler, Steelhead and Maws one cycles (ワンターンキル)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fAg_hsA7c_no76pzlVR5EhiYgwki9XfFyP4Tz7Dev3A/edit?usp=sharing)

There are also additional techniques which are more specific. A very extensive list is made by Teleraid explaining many SR specific techniques: [A current list of salmon run and some normal weapon tech that I am aware of so far.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rPFIEdqrCuXLNUpCi_PX7B_XzfUZA5AJ6LNLad1qBvs/edit)
It’s highly recommended to read this list. However, below are some of the most notable mentions from this list:

- [**Stinger OHKO (Blaster)**](https://twitter.com/GungeeSpla/status/1002389011736850432)
  Stingers can be taken down with a single hit from a blaster (except Clash Blaster and Grizzco Blaster) by aiming slightly above the red pot
- [**Stinger OHKO (Grizzco Slosher)**](https://twitter.com/krakonrollerist/status/1125127728271953922)
  By aiming for the top of the stinger and keeping the right distance, you can use the falloff from the Grizzco Slosher to take down a stinger in one shot
- [**Stinger double pot flick (Roller)**](https://twitter.com/Sig_770/status/982123158382624768)
  When positioned and angled correctly, it’s possible to take away two pots with one flick. For this you need to hit with only the edge of the roller (don’t hit with the centre) and aim slightly upward, like in the video.
- **Basket cancel (Slosher)**
  Tri-Slosher, Slosher and Sloshing Machine can cancel the endlag of their slosh by depositing an egg into the basket when the slosh animation occurs.

# Special Waves

## Fog

Having awareness for Goldies is important, particularly in the presence of Steelheads. It’s common for Steelheads to be killed a bit further away from the basket. However, because of that it’s possible for the Steelhead to unintentionally kill a Goldie further away from the basket than preferred, as you want these to be killed exactly at the basket due to their 10 egg potential drop. Therefore, whenever you kill a Steelhead it’s important that you are aware if a Goldie is nearby or not. In the case that there is, you should not kill the Steelhead and let the Goldie reach the basket first.

Similarly due to these 10 egg potential Goldies, awareness of missiles and rays become even more important in Fog. These Goldies can allow many eggs to be dropped at the basket, in which case it becomes important that the host is not disturbed by any missiles or rays in order to deposit these eggs as fast as possible. When you are targeted by either missiles or ray, make sure to avoid these from targeting the host. If possible, it’s preferred to intentionally take aggro from these bosses so that they do not aggro the host.

Additionally, in the presence of these threats it becomes very important that not all players start piling up on the basket in an attempt to get these eggs. Doing so can cause the entire team to get wiped and simultaneously slow down the process of depositing the eggs. Especially if there’s enough time left, prioritize removing pressure from the basket so that the host can safely deposit the eggs.

An extra advantage that Fog has compared to normal waves is that all spawns are random, including lessers. This results in bosses spawning with fewer lessers than usual, allowing far eggs to be more accessible. Make sure to take advantage of these random spawns by running these eggs when the time is available. However, if time is limited, make sure that no bosses are lured away from the basket, especially not Goldies.

## Cohock Charge

Similar to Fog, awareness of ray and missiles are very important. Especially on maps like Spawning Grounds where the egg running path lies closely within the cannons, it should be avoided to have missiles and ray land on the cannon user as eggs are run.

For the cannon user there are also certain specific angles, or even limitations to be aware of when using the cannons. Particularly for Flyfish there are a few spots on Lost Outpost and Salmonid Smokeyard which are very tricky to hit, but possible. Mastering these are vital for improving the egg score on these maps. Here are references showcasing these angles:

[Example of precise Flyfish cannon shots (1st Flyfish in clip)](https://twitter.com/yurayuraray/status/1284990900968415232?s=21)

On Salmonid Smokeyard, the right cannon also has the limitation of not being able to hit the far left Stinger. When this Stinger spawns, it’s especially important for the egg runners to be aware of this and take it down. Or if needed the cannon users can temporarily rotate to the other cannon to take it down.

On Ruins of Ark Polaris, if the Snatcher trick is mastered by the cannon users, Steel Eels can be killed early so that they do not force the players out of the cannons. Like normal waves, it is also possible to kill some bosses early on any map, if other bosses can be lured while egg running takes place.

Cannon users who have become good at managing their ink should watch Snatchers taking away far eggs on any map, but the egg runners should make sure to grab the far eggs first whenever possible. When that isn’t possible, a good cannon user can watch them.

## Rush

For Rush, most of the problems that squads can face while Overfishing relate to playing too safely. To have a higher score on this wave, risks need to be taken almost always. To build confidence, understanding the timer and weapon role fundamentals can be a good foundation.

Some risks that can be taken are going for farther Golden Eggs while you don’t have aggro before the next timer change happens or when someone is using a special, or moving up towards the incoming Chums with a weapon that can handle them. Positioning can help to make this process easier, so make sure to check out Maps channel on the Overfishing Server for more information.

It’s also important to know where to kill the Goldie especially with more powerful, high DPS weapons. Golden Eggs during Rush have predetermined spots as to where they land after the Goldie is killed, so figuring out the best possible location to kill the Goldie to minimize the Golden Eggs from landing too far is important. For example, you would want to kill the Goldie on Marooner’s Bay after it’s crossed the grate area and directly next to the basket on Salmonid Smokeyard.

## Grillers

In this wave, it’s important to kill the first Griller as soon as possible in order to spawn a new one faster to have a higher net Golden Egg gain. Two things are involved in this process: where to kill the Griller, and pathing the Griller.

Based on the map and tide combination, the location of where you kill the Griller changes. In most cases the Griller is killed closer to the basket except for the very first Griller since its Golden Eggs can be retrieved easily far away without wasting time.

Pathing the Griller involves knowing how Grillers move. All Grillers, no matter the tide or map, have a predetermined path on how they move. By memorizing the path, you can predict how the Griller will move for easier stuns.

The common thread between these two notions are speed: as stated before, speed is the name of the game and killing faster leads to more Golden Eggs. That’s why it’s very important to understand that for pathing Grillers you need to reduce the amount of turns it takes. This involves knowing where to stand to lead the Griller on the correct path, while also understanding that the fastest path isn’t the one with the shortest distance but rather the straightest path! More information can be found in the [Map masterpost](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DxkNra90b1Esficr28uSSnsc9U4pha4p?usp=sharing)

## Goldie Seeking

For Goldie Seeking it’s important to be aware of all the possible Goldie paths to know where you should kill it in order to deposit the eggs as fast as possible and find the next Goldie. Generally this is as close to the basket as possible, particularly in HT where the Goldies are found and killed much faster, which leaves less time for depositing eggs.

In the case that the first Goldie spawns far from the basket, it’s preferred to already damage the Goldie and take those eggs as the Goldie will need more time to travel to the basket. Preferably you want to take 5 eggs as this will shrink the Goldie and thus speed up. At any point where there’s no eggs to be run or lessers to be cleared the strategy of getting an early egg can be applied.

On top of knowing the possible Goldie paths, it’s also important to use its head as a guide for knowing exactly where it’s heading. Take for example this Goldie spawn on Bay:

![Bay Goldie Path](https://abload.de/img/baygoldiepathyrk7w.png)

The path to D and A overlap which makes it more difficult to know which gusher the Goldie is heading towards. However, the Goldie has an added feature where with its head it will look at the gusher it’s heading towards. This can be used here to determine whether the Goldie is heading towards D or A, as the Goldie's head will be slightly more angled depending on if it's entering D or A. This is vital as it determines where the Goldie should be killed. If it enters D the Goldie must be killed just before the gusher which is before the grates. However, if the Goldie is heading towards A you want to avoid killing the Goldie before the grates as this will slow down the process of depositing the eggs. A reference for both of these paths can be seen in this tweet: https://twitter.com/Minaraii/status/1229254494497755136.
You can find all the Goldie paths with the [Salmon Learn app](https://gungeespla.github.io/salmon_learn/)

When the timer gets close to 0 you might have to make a judgement based on the amount of eggs and time available, whether or not you should look for a next Goldie. Particularly on Mid Tide this becomes important as the process of finding a Goldie takes up more time. Because of this, if there’s not enough time left to deposit all the eggs left at the end of the wave it can be favourable to stop looking for a next Goldie and have the entire team focus on eggs. This can sometimes be like a coin flip though, as it’s possible for the next Goldie to spawn next to the basket, which could potentially allow for more eggs. However, on Mid Tide this is unlikely.

## Mothership

During this special wave, ideally you are constantly running Golden Eggs if weapon roles (long range, lightweight speed, etc) are applied. Because of this idea it’s possible to run Golden Eggs and kill Chinooks at the same time since you can throw bombs. You have the liberty to throw a bomb at any point because your ink tank is naturally full almost always. They can be thrown at coolers too to minimize the amount of lessers dealt with. Memorizing the predetermined spots where Chinooks drop their coolers / land can help with knowing where to throw bombs, and eventually it’ll be muscle memory.

Another strategy is Mothership Cheese, which refers to using weapons to hit the spawn point of Chinooks as they come out of the Mothership. It can be done with most of the longer range weapons such as Rapid Blaster Pro, Jet Squelcher, Ballpoint Splatling, Bamboozler, and many more. Some other weapons with smaller ranges but high velocity shots can also cheese the Mothership. One way is using the rails on Ruins of Ark Polaris mid tide or low tide Mothership by holding the jump button, shooting the weapon, and holding back so you don’t fall off to reach the spawn point. Another way is to use weapons with high velocity shots or ones with a large area of effect to hit the tube of the Mothership in a precise way that kills spawning Chinooks. Some weapons that can do this include the Nautilus 47, Luna Blaster, Sloshing Machine, Glooga Dualies, L-3 Nozzlenose, and more. Finally, some specials that can also reach the top of Mothership are Inkjet and Bomb Rush. They should only be used if Sting Ray and a cheesing weapon are unavailable.

After the Mothership has been repelled on the second approach, there is a 5 Chinook bonus that spawns directly after. The Golden Eggs that result from that bonus can sometimes land in unfavorable spots away from the basket that can’t be run in time before the wave ends. There are some ways to mitigate or prevent this from happening: 1) Grab the singular Golden Eggs as the Mothership latches onto the basket to free up pre-determined occupied Golden Egg spots or 2) Kill the bonus Chinooks late by stopping the Sting Ray and then restarting it in time. Some threads and clips that show off these strategies:

# Maps

## Spawning Grounds

### High tide changing boss path

On Spawning Grounds High Tide it’s possible for bosses to spawn very far on the grates. Especially in the case of Steelheads it’s common for players to trigger them as they’re still on the grates, which is slow for getting the Golden Eggs. To prevent this, it’s possible to change the path they take by clinging on the wall close to the basket as shown in this video: [Steelhead grate water drop through wall cling](https://twitter.com/GungeeSpla/status/1166746348235804672)

Additionally, this same effect can be achieved by standing on the lower ground while none of the other players are interfering with the lure:
[Steelhead grate water drop through lower platform](https://twitter.com/GungeeSpla/status/1334169298009395201)

### Ramp inkjet lure

There are very minor, but important height differences located near the basket on Spawning Grounds. These can be used to pull off an inkjet lure for Steelheads spawning from the docks: [Spawning Grounds Inkjet Lure](https://twitter.com/GungeeSpla/status/1239212448898379776)
Remember to not get too close to the Steelheads. The minor height difference just barely allows for this lure to be possible, so it’s very easy to accidentally trigger the Steelheads attack phase by getting too close.

## Marooner’s Bay

### Lift Lures

A very commonly used technique on Bay is the use of the propeller lifts to get bosses to the basket more quickly. These are used for Steelheads, Scrappers and Goldies during Fog. Other bosses cannot be lifted up (or they already go up regardless like maws).
Especially for Steelheads this can require precise movement for the lift lure to work. By making the right movement it’s possible to prevent the Steelhead from starting its attack phase and instead move towards you onto the lift. Below are the 3 cases listed in order of least to most challenging.

**Left lift 1:**

![Steelhead Left Lift Lure 1](https://abload.de/img/steelheadliftlure1g6jvz.png)

It’s possible for Steelheads spawning from this location to go directly onto the lift. When this happens you simply need to get onto the lift at the same time the Steelheads goes onto it and shoot up the fan after it moves towards you against the wall.

**Right lift:**

![Steelhead Right Lift Lure](https://abload.de/img/steelheadrightliftlur2gj5t.png)

Steelheads spawning from right will never go onto the lift unless this technique is applied. To get the Steelhead onto the lift you need to wait on top at the boat until the Steelhead reaches the location shown on the picture. From here you drop down onto the lift, and when timed properly the Steelhead should follow you onto the lift. Again, you wait until the Steelhead pushes you against the wall and then you shoot up the lift.

**Left Lift 2**

![Steelhead Left Lift Lure 2](https://abload.de/img/steelheadleftliftlureyajrl.png)
![Steelhead Left Lift Lure 2 (in-game)](https://abload.de/img/steelheadleftliftlurenik81.png)

While it’s possible for Steelheads spawning from the lowest dock to go directly onto the lift. It’s most common to see Steelheads go around the lift. Even though it's still possible to get them onto the lift.
Similar to the **Right lift** lure you need to wait until the Steelhead reaches this specific spot as shown in the picture. However, additionally you need to make a very specific jump as shown by the pink arrow. After you make this jump you fall backwards and go back onto the lift. When done right the Steelhead should follow you onto the lift.

For more visual guidance it’s highly recommended to watch this video, which showcases all of these Steelhead techniques in more detail: [Steelhead Lift explained (full version)](https://youtu.be/OFpZEvKROeQ)

## Lost Outpost

### Anti-rain zones

An important aspect of rain (from Drizzler torpedos) is that it does not inflict damage onto players located below a ceiling or any other cover above them. For Lost Outpost there are several of these anti-rain zones:

![Lost Outpost Anti-rain Zones](https://abload.de/img/lostoutpostanti-rainz2lkub.png)

Standing in any of these red boxes will prevent you from taking damage from rain, due to a ceiling hanging above these entrances. Note that there is not a ceiling located above the top entrance, so standing here will not prevent you from taking damage from rain. It’s common for Drizzlers to position outside the house, causing rain to damage players inside, so particularly on Lost Outpost the use of these anti-rain zones are very useful.

### Steelhead lures

It’s common for Steelheads attack phases to be triggered outside the house due to the little amount of space available inside, which slows down the process of luring them to the basket. As such, it’s common to use the inside walls to position yourself above the Steelheads hitbox, which stops it from starting another attack phase and instead lures them towards your position

![Lost Outpost Steelhead Lure](https://abload.de/img/lostoutpoststeelheadlb9k09.png)

These strategies become especially useful when the timer goes below 30, because as the timer runs out lures become more and more important. However, it’s worth noting that this strategy should not be excessively used. When the team is in position to simply retreat from the Steelhead the trick is not necessary. Only when the team is too close and dealing with other threats should this be done.

### Window awareness

The house blocks the majority of the view on this map and challenges a player’s awareness even more as a result. As such, using the windows to your advantage is important to not miss out on any boss spawns. Below is an example of using the windows for better awareness. However, there are far more angles possible to notice boss spawns. Try to utilize them all as much as possible.

### Window bomb trick

Using the window located in the direction of Low Tide you can also see if a flyfish is spawned in this location. When this is the case, it’s possible to hit the left launcher from within the window. However, the movement and bomb throw needs to be very precise for it to reach the launcher:

For Explosher it’s possible to even hit both of the launchers, with particularly the second shot requiring a very precise angle: [Flyfish window trick with Explosher](https://twitter.com/gameaka_ST/status/1288479989038346243)

### Lift de-aggro

An important thing to remember is that lifts can be used to remove aggro Eels (and Grillers, but it’s preferred to not do this during grillers). Especially when going for far eggs or Stingers/Flyfish, these lifts can be used to prevent luring Eels away from the basket as you go away.

### Lift teamplay and usage

Having teammates push damage the fans can speed up the process of moving from one side to the other. In some cases it can even make the difference between one more egg. However, this requires a lot of trust in your teammates to both damage the fans, and also time them properly. Below are two examples showcasing this:

Additionally, [fans can be used on their way back as well](https://twitter.com/reykodoes/status/1300800883819593728).

### Inkrail Steelhead lure

It’s possible for Steelheads coming from the shore (low tide) to be lured close to the basket by using the inkrail. You stay on the ramp (this ramp can be used to already lure Steelheads closer compared to staying at the basket) and as the Steelhead comes close you jump onto the rail to increase your height, which allows the Steelhead to walk further.
