        <p>
          Plus Server is a Discord server for high level western players to look
          for people to play with and against. It was founded on September 2017.
          Divided into three tiers of which +1 is the highest. You get access
          when a member of the server suggests you and you pass the monthly
          voting.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the voting you get a percentage based on your result. 0% would mean
          everyone who participated in the voting downvoted you while 100% would
          be the opposite. 50% is required to pass the voting. If a member gets
          a score below 50% they get demoted a tier or in the case of +3 kicked.
