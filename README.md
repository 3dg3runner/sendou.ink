Live version: [https://sendou.ink/](https://sendou.ink/)

## What's happening

I'm making this site as a school project of full stack web development. It is my first time working on a web site project of my own so it's very much a learning experience in that sense.

First working feature is searching for past results of Top 500 of X Rank in Splatoon 2. Going forward the plan is to work on different features as well as guides.

## Technologies used

* React
* Node.js
* GraphQL (Apollo)
* MongoDB (Mongoose)
* Python (couple different scripts to parse data)

2) Use `npm install` in the root folder
