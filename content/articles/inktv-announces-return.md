In a [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/InkTVSplat/status/1584590544205930496) released on Monday, October 24th, 2022, InkTV announced that it would be returning to the Splatoon competitive scene. This platform is dedicated highlighting the players and teams involved in competitive Splatoon. They were heavily involved in developing tournaments, podcast feeds, and player interviews in an effort to grow the community.

InkTV was retired in early 2020, just as the Covid-19 pandemic began to escalate. Now with tournaments being held again and the incredibly successful launch of a new game in Splatoon 3, InkTV is ready to make its return.

The announcement video features some of Splatoon's most prominent community members, including caster NineWholeGrains and professional players ProChara and KyochaN. In the footage they talk about what InkTV did in the past and how it helped them grow and develop as individuals. Everyone was then surprised with the return announcement.

Be sure to follow InkTV on social media so you can be part of the ever-growing Splatoon community. Check out the video if you haven't already so you can get excited for what InkTV will have in store.
